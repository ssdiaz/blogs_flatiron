Hi there! This is my first blog during my Flatiron bootcamp so here goes...

I am in the Software Engineering program and I really enjoy getting to code again! During college, I minored in Management Information Systems and worked on a project with 4 other students to re-vamp an old website using WordPress. This project was challenging but exciting, and at the time it had never occurred to me that people do this for a living. However years later during my professional career in Corporate Finance operations, I enjoyed building VBA macros to help automate my daily Excel process by using code from Stack Overflow. And finally I realized coding is a path to a career that will really hold my interest. 

The reason why I decided to do this bootcamp is because I want to make coding a career, specifically in Web Development. This is something I've always enjoyed reading about in my spare time and have been dreaming about for years. Also, I am an organized person who loves to make things look neat and pretty (throwback to my MySpace page circa 2007). And really there is no better feeling than coding a program and seeing it come to life on your screen, knowing that it was you who instructed the program to behave in that way. 

Through my time at Flatiron I hope to deeply understand the full potential of using Ruby, HTML, and JavaScript to create webpages, and to have the foundation to be able to learn other programming languages I'll encounter as a developer. I also want to make connections with other members in the bootcamp and set up some pair programming hours to really ensure I practice what I'm learning (which actually, I got to do today!). 

I'm very excited to officially start this journey, wish me luck!
